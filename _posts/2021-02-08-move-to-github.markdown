As of today the canonical source for yaboot will be on [GitHub][yaboot-url].  The url `yaboot.ozlabs.org` shoudl continue to work as expected.

There are a few issues I'm working on, like [the default branch][issue-one]

[yaboot-url]: https://github.com/yaboot/yaboot
[iussue-one]: https://github.com/yaboot/yaboot/issues/1
