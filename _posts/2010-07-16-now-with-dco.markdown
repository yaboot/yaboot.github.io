Yaboot will now be following a process similar to the linux kernel's  Any
patch submitted for inclusion in yaboot must have a "Signed-Off-By" stating
that the submitter agrees with the "Developer's Certificate of Origin" (DCO).
The DCO can be found in the root of the yaboot source directory from 1.3.16 on.
